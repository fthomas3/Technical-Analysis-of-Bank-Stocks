# Technical-Analysis-of-Bank-Stocks
In this project I analyzed and vizualized data from 6 different banks (Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo Capital)

Brief overview of what I did in this project:

• Analyzed stock price movements of 6 banks from the fiscal years 2006 to 2016 using python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and plotly

• Created interactive technical analysis charts (candle plots, bollinger band plots, etc) using plotly to visualize data in a presentable manner

• Calculated both daily and 30-day percent changes as well as standard deviations of price movements based on 2,517 values per bank to evaluate which banks would be a riskier investment

# The interactive technical analysis plots will not be visible on github since I used plotly to create them. If you would like to see them, please feel free to copy the code onto a jupyter notebook. I am really sorry for any inconvinience this may cause. The rest of the visualization and analysis that I did is accessible through the github!
