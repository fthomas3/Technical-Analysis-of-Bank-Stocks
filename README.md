# Technical-Analysis-of-Bank-Stocks
In this project I analyzed and vizualized data from 6 different banks (Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo Capital)

Brief overview of what I did in this project:

• Analyzed stock price movements of 6 banks from the fiscal years 2006 to 2016 using python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and plotly

• Created interactive technical analysis charts (candle plots, bollinger band plots, etc) using plotly to visualize data in a presentable manner

• Calculated both daily and 30-day percent changes as well as standard deviations of price movements based on 2,517 values per bank to evaluate which banks would be a riskier investment
